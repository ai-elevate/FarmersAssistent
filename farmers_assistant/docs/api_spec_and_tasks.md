        'main.py' contains the main entry point of the application. It initializes the Flask app and the database.
        'models.py' defines the User, Weather, Advice, and Reminder classes. It also handles interactions with the database.
        'views.py' handles HTTP requests and responses. It uses the models to retrieve data and render templates.
