### User Story
Sarah, an example of a typical user
Sarah is a 40 something stay at home mom, has an interest in gardening and wants to extend her knowledge to cut flower growing. She interested in the “slow flower movement” (a movement towards locally grown flowers, rather than those grown abroad, e.g., Columbia.) Sarah would like to sell flowers from her small flower stand at the end of her driveway. However, she is overwhelmed by figuring out which types of flowers to grow, when to start seeds, when to plant the plant starts, and when to harvest the flowers.
Sarah finds it difficult to figure out succession planting which will allow harvesting of flowers all season long. Sarah is looking for an app that will help her visualize a bouquet of flowers both with her favorite suggestion of flowers and suggestions of the application.  These suggestions should be compatible within the region of the U.S. she lives in. 
The app should be able to advise on when to start the seeds, succession sowing any of the seeds (so she can continually harvest the flowers throughout the season), plan out the plant starts, and be advised on when she should expect to be able to harvest the flowers. 
The app should send her information on best practices of how to grow the flower varieties for her bouquets. The app should generate weather (frost) warnings for her plants. She would also like the app to tell her how many plants she can grow with the space she has available.
It would also be fantastic if the app could tell her where to buy this varieties of flowers she wants to grow. 
November to January is when people start planning their gardening year. The app should be able to help Sarah plan out her garden at that time. It should be able to send her reminders based on her flower choices to start the process of sowing her seeds.
